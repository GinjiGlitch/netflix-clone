I decided to re-create the Netflix Landing Page to text my skills in Bootstrap and flexbox. It isn't exactly identical but it can pass as a clone to the original site. 

Bootstrap and flexbox was primarily used for layout and standard CSS for styling components.

Semantic HTML5 markup was also used.
